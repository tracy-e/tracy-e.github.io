<td>Team agent</td>
<td>A <strong>team agent</strong> is legally responsible for the team and acts as the primary contact with Apple. The team agent can invite team members and change the access level of any other team member. There’s only one team agent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Team admin</td>
<td>A <strong>team admin</strong> can set the privilege levels of other team members, except the team agent. Team admins manage all assets used to sign your apps, either during development or when your team is ready to distribute an app. Team admins are the only people on a team who can sign apps for distribution on nondevelopment devices. Team admins also approve signing certificate requests made by team members.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Team member</td>
<td>A <strong>team member</strong> can gain access to prerelease content delivered by Apple in Member Center. A team member can also sign apps during development, but only after he or she makes a request for a development signing certificate and has that request approved by a team admin.</td>
